<h1>Time and space complexity</h1>
<p>The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution and efficent. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in algorithm analysis.

 It is the time needed for the completion of an algorithm. To estimate the time complexity, we need to consider the cost of each fundamental instruction and the number of times the instruction is executed.</p>	
<p>Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b>space complexity</b> of the algorithm.</p>
